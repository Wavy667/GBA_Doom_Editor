# GBA Doom Editor
A GBA Doom editor made by kgsws. Archived it here as it's fairly obscure.

## Features

- Full texture/sprite replacement support.  
- Partial graphics replacement support (images stored in WAD).  
- Sound replacement support.
- DeHackEd-like editing support for states and actors (with code-pointers).  
- Internal storage (ROM size) is limited, so it's recommended for you to remove unused graphics (yes there is plenty of unused graphics inside) before you start editing.

## Map Editing
For map editing, you'll need a nodebuilder that generates a GBA-Doom-compatible `LEAFS` lump. A nodebuilder called LBSP.exe comes with [svKaiser's GBA Doom tools](https://gbatemp.net/download/gba-doom-hacking-tools.32118/) which will do this job.
